				Hello! My name is Peter Kim. I've had an interest in computers for as
				long as I can remember. Soon enough this grew into an interest in
				programming and web design. I have experience in various languages such
				as HTML, Java, Scheme, and Python. I am constantly looking to improve
				and expand upon my skillset.
